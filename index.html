	<h1>Hi there, I'm Kristina Bartowitz!</h1>
	<p>I am a ecosystem scienctist researching impacts of climate change, and land management wildfires on forest carbon cycles. I am passionate about creating lasting, positive change for our environment at the intersection of policy and science. I would like to use my background in science and conservation to bring science to the policymaking table to focus on climate change and threats to biodiversity.
	I am currently a PhD student in Dr. Tara Hudiburg's <a href="/ITEAM"> ITEAM  lab at the University of Idaho.

	<p> I grew up in southeastern WI, and completed my BS and MS degrees at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Go Badgers!), where I studied zoology and conservation biology.  During my undergraduate education I had the opportunity to student tropical field ecology and conservation in Monteverde, Costa Rica. 
Following my undergraduate degree, I lived and worked abroad in Panama doing various conservation and biology work before beginning my master's degree. Prior to beginning my PhD research at UIdaho, I worked  in rural northern Washington state, studying post-fire recovery with an NGO and the USFS. 
I enjoy long-distance running, hiking, skiing, and playing with my dog.
